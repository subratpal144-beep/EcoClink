⚙️ BACKEND PROMPT (Logic + Simple Functions)

You won’t need a heavy backend since it’s not a real online store yet, but if the Agent AI allows backend scripting or logic (like simple Node.js, Flask, or Replit backend), use this prompt 👇

Prompt for Backend:

Add minimal backend functionality to support a simple contact form for the EcoClink website.

Requirements:

Create a “Contact” form that takes Name, Email, Message fields.

When the user submits, display a success message (“Thanks for contacting us! We’ll get back to you soon.”).

Store submissions temporarily in a local JSON file or print them in console (no database needed).

Ensure no sensitive data is collected or shared.

Backend must be lightweight and simple enough to run on a free plan.

Additionally, if supported:

Create a “Product Data” file (JSON) containing product info (Name, Price, Description, Image URL).

Fetch this JSON from the frontend to dynamically display product cards on the “Products” page.

Optional:
Add a “Visitor Counter” at the bottom of the homepage that updates whenever someone opens the site.
